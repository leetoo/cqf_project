<p>Interest rate curves and curve time-series data types for HJM processing</p>
<p>Both historical curves and Monte Carlo simulations are stored in {@link com.luigisgro.cqf.curve.CurveTimeSeries} objects.
By implementing {@link com.luigisgro.cqf.curve.CurveTimeSeriesOperator}, all the derivatives can generate cash flows processing
the specific {@link com.luigisgro.cqf.curve.CurveTimeSeries}, and therefore they can be evaluated with Monte Carlo methods.</p>
