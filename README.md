# cqf_project
Final project for the CQF - cohort January 2011

This is the final project for the Certificate in Quantitative Finance, which I have developed at the end of the courses, in June/July 2011.

There could be mistakes, or imprecisions, both in the documentation and the code.

The complete documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/lsgro/cqf_project/blob/master/Luigi%20Sgro%20CQF%20Jan%202011%20Final%20Project%20Report.pdf).
